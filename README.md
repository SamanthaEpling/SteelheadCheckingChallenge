# SteelheadCheckingChallenge
A challenge to create a checking system with login/logout capabilities.

## TO MAKE CONSOLE APPLICATION WORK FOR YOU:

1. Download to Visual Studio 2022 for best capability.
2. Create a folder (I used' UserFiles') that you remember the path to, and I suggest you include it within the solution.
3. Navigate to Program.cs within the SteelheadChecking.sln folder and save the above path to the created folder for you to save all transaction and user data.
4. Run program.

### Original Challenge:

Steelhead Software Coding Exercise
You have been tasked with writing the world’s greatest banking ledger. Please code a solution that can perform the following workflows through a console application (accessed via the command line):
* Create a new account
* Login
* Record a deposit
* Record a withdrawal
* Check balance
* See transaction history
* Log out

For additional credit, you may implement this through a web page. They don’t have to run at the same time, but if you would like to do that, feel free. C# is preferred but not required. Use whatever frameworks/libraries you wish, but please provide a readme that explains how to run the program. Ideally the program will take 2-4 hours to complete.  Please provide a zipped up folder with the final project and deliver it back to us for review.


### My Work/Considerations:
My IDE of choice was Visual Studio 2022, and it took much longer to link the project divided into the following subsections:
* LogIn/Create Account
* Accounting Transactions
* Linking specific transactions to certain accounts.
* Providing the package of this information. 

### Additional/Future considerations:
* Changing my variable naming conventions, I'm still in the neverending learning process of the best names.
* Refactoring some recycling portions of code. 
* Using a library to create a "prettier" table in a console application.
* Completing the additional credit of implementing to a web page.
